## Restriction by domain

If your federation settings allow it, the chatbot is accessible to everyone on
Skype for Business even outside the company.

However, you can restrict access to it on the channel Skype for Business by
entering the domain to which you want to allow access. Only a user of the
domains listed in the configuration will be able to talk to the chatbot.
