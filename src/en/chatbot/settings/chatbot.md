It is possible to restrict access to the chatbot through three authorization mode:
- by domain 
- by configuring a white list 
- via an authorization API

## Restriction by domain

If your federation settings allow it, the chatbot is accessible to everyone on
Skype for Business even outside the company.

</div>



However, you can restrict access to it on the channel Skype for Business by
entering the domain to which you want to allow access. Only a user of the
domains listed in the configuration will be able to talk to the chatbot.

## White list

You can also restrict the acess to the chatbot by setting up a whitel liste. This latter will contain people who will be allowed to talk to the chatbot. 
This option is availible for the whole channels.

You can cerate a new list or select an already existing list.

The adress which allows to identity a user in the white list, it’s different
according to the channel:

-   Skype for Business: SIP adress
-   Microsoft Teams: UPN adress
-   Webchat: the adress depend on the configuration

- Then select the HTTP verb : POST or PUT
- Enter the URL of your API
- Enter the Body you want to send to your API. Example: {name:'Dupont'}

You have the possibility to test your authorization API before publication. To do this, use the "TRY" button at the top right of your configuration page.
