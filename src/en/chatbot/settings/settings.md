## Authorization

By clicking on “I authorize you”, the chatbot will be updated. It is recommended
to update this authorisation each 90 days. 

This authorization allows the chatbot to retrieve the Visio file in order to synchronize them. 
When the authorization expires, click on the "I authorize you" button to renew your connection to SharePoint. 
Don't forget to click on SAVE. 


## Dashboard

This tab allows to s choose the date from which you want to display the
dashboards.

* [**Performance dashboard**](/en/chatbot/dashboards/performance.html)
* [**Usage dashboard**](/en/chatbot/dashboards/usage.html)


When resetting the date, the chatbot performance and usage statics will only be displayed starting from the chosen date. 
Delete the date if you want to return to the previous information. 



## Sharepoint

You can import a SharePoint site and library. This sharepoint library is needed to store your Visio files, which are used to create conversation trees, starting flows and escalation. 

Once the library is configured, click on "Import a library from SharePoint" and add the library URL.

## API KEY

When the chatbot uses an API via a conversation tree, the API key is sent. In
order to verify and secure calls to external APIs, you can integrate the
verification of this external API key into your APIs.

If the key is not sent in the "witivio-apikey" header of the request then it is
because the call does not come from the chatbot and therefore it is better to
ignore the call and forward an HTTP 403 response.

If you think the API key is no longer secure, then you can regenerate it. Don't
forget to modify it in your APIs.
