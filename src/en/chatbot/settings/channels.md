## Security of the chatbot 

The Webchat allows you to manage the **security of the chatbot** in a better way. It allows you to know where the webchat is deployed. For governance purposes, it is mandatory to explicitly indicate where the webchat is located, and therefore declare the different sites on which it will be available.

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Without this explicit definition, the webchat will not upload to your site**. This prevents a person from adding webchat without permission.
:::

::: danger üî¥
The Webchat also appears in the Webchat channel settings tab, so you can test and talk directly to the chatbot in production.
