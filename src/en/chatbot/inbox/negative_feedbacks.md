The Feedback is triggered after each answer provided by the chatbot. It measures
the satisfaction of the user.

The Feedback tab in the inbox only groups negative feedbacks. When the user
indicates that he is unsatisfied, the chatbot asks the reason for the dissatisfaction:

-   The answer contains mistakes
-   The answer is incomplete
-   The answer has no correspondence with the question asked
-   Other reason

For each question, you can then know the reason for the user's dissatisfaction.
The coach will be able to carry out the necessary corrective actions in the
Inbox tab.
