When the chatbot is not sure of the question asked by the user, it suggests
several choices of questions. The user selects the right question and the
chatbot give then the answers.

The Active Learning is triggered when the chatbot has a doubt about the
understanding of the question. Several questions in the knowledge base trigger a
high score [**(Scoring rules)**](/en/chatbot/inbox/scoring_rules.html) (difference of less than 20 points between
the different questions).

    Active Learning is triggered. For example: "Do you mean..." (2).

    return (3).
