The conversations and the identity of users are registered. The user can be
informed that the conversations are registered. These privacy policies are
configured beforehand but can be modified: [**Privacy policies**](/en/chatbot/settings/privacy.html). 

You can find all conversations in the tab **Tools** > **History**. 

> Use filters to choose the period of time you want to display the conversation history or search the user who talked to the chatbot.

> Click on the wished conversation to get more details about the exchange between the chatbot and the user. 

> You can also filter the conversation history by profiles or channels if available. 

> Finally, you can export the history by using the EXPORT button in the top right corner.
