In this tab you can enable/disable and also set up the Feedback tool. It
measures user satisfaction in relation to the chatbot answers. It asks for
example: "Are you satisfied with my answer?".

Here are some examples of the answers given by the chatbot :

-   When the user is satisfied: “Thank you for your feedback”
-   When the user is not satisfied: “Thank you for your feedback, I keep working
    to get better
-   When the user ignore the feedback: “ No problem if you do not want to give
    me your feedback” ( you can activate/deasctive the display of this message)

When the user is not satisfied, the chatbot ask the reason, for example : “Is
the defect one of … “ or “Describe the issue”.
