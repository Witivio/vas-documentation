The minimum score difference between one question and another in order to **start the Active Learning** can also be configured.

As a reminder, **the Active Learning is triggered when the chatbot has a doubt about the understanding of the question and several questions in the knowledge base trigger a
high score [**(Scoring rules)**](/en/chatbot/inbox/scoring_rules.html) (difference of less than 20 points between
the different questions).
