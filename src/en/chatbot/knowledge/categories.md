### What for ?
---
Questions in the knowledge base (KB) can be categorized to simplify searching
and display. However, these categories are not available for users, but only for
coaches, to help them in the continuous improvement of the chatbot.

In the FAQ tab, you can then filter your questions by category in the search
bar.

If a sorting by categories has been done in the knowledge base, you will find in
the dashboards tab the percentage of categories most requested by users.


### How ?
---
In the “Categories” tab, enter the name of your category and click on “+” to add
it.

The new category will be displayed and you will also have the number of
questions belonging to the category.

The "Editorial" category is already present in the platform. Here, you can for
example add questions that do not correspond to any other category. Once added,
a category can be modified (pen icon) or deleted (trash icon).
