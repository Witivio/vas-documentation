</div>


### What for ?
---
In the “KB” tab you can configure all the questions you want the chatbot to
answer as well as the expected answers.

Building a knowledge base means answering the following questions:

-   What should my chatbot answer?

-   Who are the users of my chatbot?

Before starting to build your knowledge base, please read the technical [**limitations**](/en/chatbot/limitations.html) .


### How ?

## Import

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/knowledge/kb2.png')" alt="low score">
</div>



If you already have a knowledge base, for example several questions and answers
from a FAQ, you can import this data into the platform. The file must be in
Excel format and follow this specific form:

-   **Column 1:** Questions
-   **Columns 2:** The answers
-   **Alternatives:** below the “principal” question. The altenative will be
    different than the e the same.

::: tip 📖 What is a “principal” question? 
It is the question that is displayed
prominently in your knowledge base. Each principal question can have several
alternatives. The chatbot will not make the difference between a principal
question and its alternative when it comes to understanding the question of the
user.

</div>

::: warning ⚠️
**In column 2 (answer)**
:::

Copy/Paste the answer to have exactly the same for the question and the
alternatives. If it’s written differently, the alternative will not be linked to
its principal question.

::: warning ⚠️
**Title and header**
:::

The Excel file to be imported must not have a column title and header.

To import the file, click on “IMPORT”.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/knowledge/kb4.png')" alt="low score">

The "EXPORT" tab allows you to download the knowledge base. It is possible to
download by categories by adding a filter before exporting.

Search in the knowledge base

It is possible to find a question more easily and quickly by typing one or more
words in the search bar.

You also have filters to help you find a question in your knowledge base. You
can therefore filter by:

- Categories
- Type of answers: simple answer, adaptive card, contextual answer,conversation tree, Webhooks, Microsoft Flow, Azure Logic Apps.
- Publication status: Recently added or modified an not trained, Trained and not published, Published in integration, Published in production.
- No answers
- Few alternatives
- Select All

* Status: Fill in the status of your question and add a tag to facilitate the construction of your chatbot's knowledge base (Ready to be published or validated).
* Tags: Improve, complete the answer,... It's up to you to determine the use of this feature!

You can also add tags to your chatbots from the Settings tab > Settings > Bot.




The knowledge base corresponds to all questions that the chatbot will be able to
answer. [**The creation process**](/en/chatbot/Knowledges/Creation%20process.html) includes all the steps to create, modify,
test and finally publish the questions and answers.

In order to enrich the chatbot's knowledge base, it is necessary to add:

-   [**Questions**](/en/chatbot/knowledge/kb.html#new-question)
-   [**Alternatives**](/en/chatbot/knowledge/kb.html#alternatives) 
-   [**Answers**](/en/chatbot/knowledge/kb.html#types-of-answer)

### New question


1.  First, choose the category in which you want to add your question. Choose an
    existing category or add a new one.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/knowledge/nexquestion1.png')" alt="low score">
</div>



1.  Select “FREE TEXT” if you want to write the question. Otherwise, choose one
    of the templates, for instance “What’s .. for”, “How many”, … to create your
    question.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/knowledge/nexquestion2.png')" alt="low score">
</div>


::: danger 🔴
When you use a template, the platform will generate **alternatives**
automatically.
:::

Once created, the question is displayed and it will then be possible to modify
it , delete it, add the answer and also new alternatives.

### Adaptive card

You can configure an Adaptive Card answer with a visual designer for advanced layout (image, media, action set, … ). This answer type is supported in Webchat and Microsoft Teams channels. You will not have access to Adaptive Cards on the Skype channel, however if you have several channels you can design a simple Adaptive Card answer for the Teams and Webchat channels and write a simple text answer for the Skype and SMS channels.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/knowledge/answersimple2.png')" alt="low score">
</div>


Several elements in the toolbox allow you to create an Adaptive Card. To do this, drag the elements from "Containers" and/or "Elements" into the Adaptive Card.

Then click on the + at the top right (1) to display the properties of the dragged elements, in order to modify them as wished.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/knowledge/answersimple3.png')" alt="low score">
</div>


#### CONTAINERS

* **Container**: it is possible to put elements of "Elements" in the container ( TextBlock, Rich TextBlock, Image and Media)
* **ImageSet**: Add multiple images. Once this element has been dragged into your Adaptive Card, click on the + at the top right (1) then on the "Add an image" button to add as many images as you wish.
* **FactSet**: Add elements here to categorize. For example, for example
  * Fact 1 = Name / Value 1 = Smith
  * Fact 2 = First name / Value 2 = Bryan
  * Click on "Add a new fact" if you want to add an additional element
* **ColumnSet**: It is possible to put several columns and thus add one element among "Elements" per column (text, image, media...)


#### ELEMENTS

TextBlock: use this element to add text to your Adaptive Cards

* **Rich TextBlock**: use the **JSON editor** to edit text
* **Image**: ⚠️ add the URL of the image you want to add
* **Media**: It is possible to add a video but it will only be available on the Webchat (the media element is not available for the Teams channel)

It is also possible to create an Adaptive Card using a JSON code. To do this, click on "JSON" at the bottom left of the page.

### Contextual answer

>The chatbot retrieves a context element from the user in order to provide with the appropriate answer. As a consequence, before giving the answer, the chatbot ask a question to the user.

One you create the new question (1), click on it and choose “contextual answer”.

In the first box, add the question that the chatbot asks to the user (2). For example:

For example, for the question “How many days of paid annual leave do I have?”, before giving the answer, the chatbot need to know the seniority of the user. The chatbot will then give the appropriate answer.

<div class="image_center">

Click on "Train" and wait until the button is greyed out, before continuing to build your knowledge.
:::

#### Witivio shape

* **Bot Message**: this shape corresponds to a bot message
* **Bot Input**: The chatbot asks a question and the answer of the user will be saved in the variable
* **API call**: Call an API, http method (GET/POST). For example: GET URL. If there are variables, they will be sended to the API.
* **Bot Questions**: Add “Choices”. The chatbot ask the user a question with a list of choices. (Saved in “Input”).
* **Bot Feedback**: Add this shape to to request feedbacks from the user.

For example, if the chatbot need to ask a question to the user, add the “Bot Question” shape. First, drag and drop the shape onto the page to specify the entity and its attributes. To fill a choice, simply double-click on it. To add a new choice, drag and drop the “Choice” shape onto the “Bot Question” shape.

## Alternatives


An alternative is a reformulation of the principal question. The number of
alternatives to a main question is displayed below on the right.

<div class="image_center">

</div>




If you select a template when creating the question , it will have several
alternatives automatically.

::: danger 🔴
These alternatives created automatically, called "**simple**" alternatives are
rewording of the main question, using the same words. Only users can provide the
chatbot with "**complex**" alternatives. The latter are formulated differently
but lead to the same answer.
:::

Example :

-   Main question : Where can I find the reset password process?
-   Simple alternative : Where are the reset password process?
-   Complex alternative : I forgot my password, how can I reset it?


::: tip 💡 Good practices
A main question must have at least 5 complex alternatives and
the maximum number of altenatives is 99 (simple+complex) .
:::

Click on the altenatives to add new ones or delete. You can use Free text or
templates to add alternatives. Tick one or several alternatives to delete them
(trash icon).
