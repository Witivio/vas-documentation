-   **Number of distinct users**
-   **Average conversation time**
-   **Total number of conversations**

**Messages**
---------------


This graph shows the **number of messages from users** and the number of
messages **from the chatbot** over the selected period.

**Retention**
----------------


In this dashboard there is also a **retention graph** that measures user
engagement, that is to say the rate of usage over a given period of time.

**The retention rate** therefore corresponds to the proportion of users who come
to talk to the chatbot on a specific day without taking into account any
interactions the user may have had with the chatbot before that particular day.
(Here, over a given period: the last 7 or 14 days).

In order **to interpret a retention graph**, it is necessary to understand that
the temporal element, i.e. the period analyzed, is found both on the x-axis and
the y-axis.

**For instance**: The 2 users who spoke to the Chatbot on 21/02/19 also
requested it on 22/02/19 (Information: 100% in column 1).

**Questions answered per categories**
---------------------------


This graph shows the distribution of the questions answered by category over the
chosen period.

</div>




**TOP Question-Answer**
--------------------------


This graph shows the ranking of the most frequently asked questions over the
given period.

For example, the question "I would like to take some time off" was asked 10
times while the question "Who to contact if I have a question about sport?" was
asked three times over the last 12 months.
