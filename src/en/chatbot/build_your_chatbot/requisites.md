# Teams prerequisites

## Prerequisites

Before performing this step, your chatbot must be created on the Witivio platform (and therefore appear in the chatbots list). The chatbot does not necessarily have to be configured. You can perform this step at the time of the chatbot’s creation or when adding a channel.

## Creation of an Azure Bot Channel

Before starting, you must have access to an Azure subscription.

## Configure the channel on the Witivio 365 application

Your channel is created on Azure. Therefore, you have all the information to activate it in the interface. To this, copy the Microsoft App ID and Microsoft Password into the corresponding fields.

Your channel is configured and your chatbot will be active on Teams in a few minutes.

### Add an image to the bot

When created, your chatbot Teams does not have a picture.

To add a photo, access the bot channel on Azure. Click on Settings then Add a picture.
