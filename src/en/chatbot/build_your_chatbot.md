## Create your chatbot

::: tip üí°Ô∏è 
It‚Äôs time to create your chatbot !

Your assistant Jeff will guide you through the creation and activation of your new chatbot. First, you need to go to [app.witivio.com](https://app.witivio.com) and click on <strong>Create a new chatbot</strong>.

<div class="image_center">

</div>


A chatbot is built to meet specific needs therefore several use cases exist: choose the suitable template to create your own chatbot. The Witivio platform then allows you to customize it by adding a name, a description and a picture.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/build_your_chatbot/trialen3.png')" alt="trialen jeff chatbot witivio">
</div>

::: tip üí° Good practice
- In order to avoid confusing a chatbot with a person, it is recommended not to use a common first name.
- It is also important not to mislead the user through the image: avoid adding a picture with a human appearance.
- The photo size is 96x96 px (.jpg, .png). You can add or modify it later in the settings menu <strong>(Settings > Bot)</strong>.
:::

The next step is to choose the channel among those available: Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams or Webchat.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/build_your_chatbot/trialen4.png')" alt="trialen jeff chatbot witivio channel">
</div>


Click on <strong>validate</strong> to finalize the creation.

## Configuration chatbot

Once the chatbot is created, a configuration phase is necessary. First, select the main language.

::: tip üí°Ô∏è Good practice
You can add other languages later in the settings menu once you created and configured the chatbot (Settings > Settings> Languages).
:::

By clicking on "I authorize you", the chatbot will be allowed to access the SharePoint site to read and write Visio files for conversation trees.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/build_your_chatbot/trialen5.png')" alt="trialen jeff chatbot witivio authorization">
</div>


- Log in using your Microsoft account.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/build_your_chatbot/trialen6.png')" alt="microsoft sign in">
</div>


- Click on "next" and then "accept" to proceed to the request of the different authorizations.

<div class="image_center">
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/en/build_your_chatbot/trialen7.png')" alt="microsoft permissions microsoft sign in">
</div>


This operation allows you to access the SharePoint site with your identity. SharePoint security is maintained, as it is your account that is used.

Your identity is saved by Witivio and remains valid for 90 days. Your Office 365 administrator can revoke it at any time.

The next step is optional and allows you to import from a SharePoint site. The latter is used to store Visio documents for conversation tree creation.
