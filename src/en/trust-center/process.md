# Intern process

At our company, we take pride in providing you with high-quality software products that meet your needs and expectations. As part of our commitment to excellence, we have a rigorous process for resolving bugs in our software.

When a bug is reported, our development team immediately begins investigating the issue. We use industry-standard tools and techniques to reproduce the problem and identify the root cause. Once the cause has been determined, we develop a fix and thoroughly test it to ensure that it does not introduce any new issues.

Before any updates are released to production, they undergo extensive testing to ensure that they meet our standards of quality and reliability. This includes both automated and manual testing to catch any potential issues that may have been missed during development.

Our goal is to provide you with software that you can rely on, without any unexpected surprises or interruptions. We take the quality of our products seriously, and we are committed to providing you with the best possible experience.


# I found a bug what should I do ? 


Bugs may occasionally occur, and we want to ensure that you have a clear and easy way to report any issues that you encounter.

If you encounter a bug in our software, we recommend that you first contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to discuss the issue. Your CSM will work with you to understand the problem and determine the best course of action.

Once you have discussed the issue with your CSM, you may be asked to create a ticket on our client portal. To do so, simply visit the following URL: https://support.witivio.com/. From there, you can create a new ticket and provide details about the bug you encountered.

We understand that reporting a bug can be frustrating, but please know that the more details you provide in your ticket, the easier it will be for our development team to identify and resolve the issue quickly. When creating a ticket, please include as much information as possible, such as steps to reproduce the issue, error messages, and any other relevant details. You may also attach any relevant screenshots or files to help us understand the issue more clearly. This will help us to better understand the problem and find a solution as soon as possible. 

Our support team will review your ticket and work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will keep you informed of our progress and let you know when the issue has been resolved.
