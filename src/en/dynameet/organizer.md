# Organizer

## Find window

I can give the order to find niches with one or more collaborators, as soon as they are available:

>« Find me a window with Nicolas »

Or by indicating a particular timing :

>« Find me a window with Nicolas next week »

Or by indicating a precise duration :


>« Find me a two hour time window with Nicolas »


The chatbot offers other slots if employees are not available in the specified slot.
